        <h1>Spec.LA</h1>

        <p>
          Spec.LA is an invitation-only makers' meetup, held monthly in Los Angeles.  There is an optional dinner at 7pm, and then the meeting convenes at 8pm.  The meeting comprises a series of 5-minute demos, followed by drinks and discussion.  All members are encouraged to demo, and <strong>invitees are required to demo</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>The Demo</h3>

        <p>
          Participants demo interesting projects that they have created or worked on and that they are proud of, are passionate about, and/or have learned something from.  Previous demos have included neurobiology, kinetic art, high-altitude ballooning, mechanical musical instruments, nascent non-profits, taxidermy, and a great many projects involving LEDs and microprocessors.
        </p>

        <p>
          All demos and invitations are for individuals only, not for groups or teams. There are no multi-participant demos. Giving a demo on a team project is fine, but the participant should concentrate on his or her own contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Esoteric or specialized demos are great. We're a diverse bunch, and we've had amazing demos from an immense range of disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Participants may show videos during a demo, but these must be limited to a total of 2 minutes in length.
        </p>

        <p>
          Participants should do a couple run-throughs beforehand. Demo-demons prey upon the unrehearsed, and it's important to get a sense of timing. Demos should be between 5 and 10 minutes in length.
        </p>

        <p>
          A participant's demo should address the following questions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              What did you want / why did you want it / what led to the creation of what you are demoing?
            </li>
            <li>
              What did you do to get what you wanted / what did you do to create your thing / what went wrong / what went right?
            </li>
            <li>
              What did you learn / what happened that you didn't expect / what would you change if you had to do it over again / what would you tell someone attempting the same thing?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Membership</h3>

        <p>
          After a successful demo, an invitee may be promoted to member. Members may attend future events with or without demoing. Members also have first priority for available demo slots at events.
        </p>

        <p>
          Members are encouraged to refer new people to <a href='/'>request an invitation</a> if they would enjoy Spec.LA and be a good addition to our events.
